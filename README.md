## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone or navigate to the project directory**

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   - The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal)
   - Vite will automatically open the browser

### Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory. To preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Data Format

The dashboard expects a JSON file at `src/data/incidents.json` with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "incident_date": "2023-01-15",
    "severity_level": "High",
    "action_cause": "Equipment Failure",
    "location": "Warehouse A",
    "region": "North",
    "behavior_type": "Unsafe Act"
  },
  ...
]
```

### Required Fields

- `id`: Unique identifier for each incident
- `incident_date`: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `severity_level`: Severity classification (e.g., "High", "Medium", "Low")
- `action_cause`: Primary cause of the incident
- `location`: Location where the incident occurred
- `region`: Geographic region
- `behavior_type`: Type of behavior involved

**Note**: All fields are optional. Missing or empty fields will be automatically replaced with "Unknown" to prevent errors.

## Key Features Explained

### Data Processing

The `dataProcessor.js` utility provides robust data handling:

- **Normalization**: Automatically replaces null, undefined, or empty values with "Unknown"
- **Grouping**: Efficiently groups data by any field
- **Filtering**: Supports filtering by year and severity
- **Aggregation**: Calculates monthly trends and top locations
- **KPI Calculation**: Computes key performance indicators

### Component Architecture

- **Modular Design**: Each chart is a reusable component
- **Separation of Concerns**: Data processing is separated from UI components
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses React hooks (useMemo) to prevent unnecessary recalculations
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful handling of edge cases

### Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach
- Grid layouts that adapt to screen size
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Optimized chart rendering for different viewport sizes

## Assumptions

1. **Data Source**: The application loads data from a local JSON file. In a production environment, this would typically be replaced with an API call.

2. **Date Format**: Incident dates are expected in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD). The application handles invalid dates gracefully.

3. **Field Values**: 
   - Severity levels are assumed to be categorical (High, Medium, Low)
   - Action causes, locations, and regions are treated as categorical data
   - All categorical fields support any string value

4. **Performance**: The application is optimized for datasets with up to several thousand records. For larger datasets, consider implementing pagination or data sampling.

5. **Browser Support**: Modern browsers that support ES6+ features and CSS Grid.

6. **No Backend**: The application is designed to work entirely client-side with no backend requirements.
